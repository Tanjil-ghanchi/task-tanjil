# MERN Task

You have to create a simple crud operation. You will have 2 table with name: 

1. products:  id, title, description, price
2. images: id, name, post_id

## Points to cover: 
1. You first have to create an API to create/update/delete/getById posts.
2. Each post should atleast have 1 image but user can upload more than 1 images.
3. While updating the post, you must have to take images in consideration.
4. Use Material UI components and and it's theming strategy. that means I should be able to
   change the theme on single click.
5. Use context api to manage data.
6. For backend you can use mongodb.
7. If you can make it real time data with subscription, that would be great.
8. You must have to use react app(create-react-app) for this task for the front.
9. For backend you can use expressjs or anything else you feel comfortable.

#### You will have 24 hours time after you start working on it. Make a github repo and submit your code there and send me a link of the repo after you are done with the code. If you can deploy your front and backend code over heroku or any other PAAS platform, would be considered as plus point.
